# Quick Start

`yarn install`

`yarn run start`

# Overview

This project uses react, redux, react-redux, and immutable.

Plain components live in `src/components`. State and action bindings for
components are in `src/containers`. Actions (simple messages that containers
dispatch) are in `src/actions`. Finally, reducers (pure functions that take
actions and state as input and compute new state) are in `src/reducers`.
